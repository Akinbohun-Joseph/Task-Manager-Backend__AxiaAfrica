Simple Task Manager API

This is the behind-the-scenes engine that powers a task management system. Think of it as the tool that lets you create, organize, and keep track of your tasks online.

## What It Does

This API (Application Programming Interface) allows you to:

* **Manage Users:**
    * Create new user accounts.
    * Log in and out securely.
    * Update your user information.
    * Remove your account if needed.
* **Manage Tasks:**
    * Add new tasks to your list.
    * See all your tasks.
    * Change the details of a task (like its description or due date).
    * Mark tasks as completed.
    * Remove tasks you no longer need.
    * Assign tasks to different users.
    * Filter tasks based on if they are completed, or by different categories.
* **Keep Things Secure:**
    * Uses a secure login system to protect your data.
    * Ensures that only authorized users can access certain parts of the system.
* **Store Your Data:**
    * Saves your task and user information in a database so it's always there when you need it.
* **Handle Errors Gracefully:**
    * Provides clear messages if something goes wrong, so you know what happened.

## How to Get Started (For Developers)

If you're a developer and want to use this API, here's a basic guide:

1.  **Get the Code:**
    * Download the code from the repository.

2.  **Install the Necessary Tools:**
    * Make sure you have the required software installed (like Node.js and MongoDB).

3.  **Set Up the Configuration:**
    * Create a configuration file with your database connection details and other settings.

4.  **Run the API:**
    * Start the API server, and it will be ready to accept requests.

## Using the API (Example)

Here's a simple example of how you might create a new user account:

* You would send a request to the API with your email and password.
* The API would create the account and send back a confirmation.

## Important Notes

* This API is designed for developers who want to build applications that manage tasks.
* It provides the backend functionality, while the user interface (what you see on the screen) would be built separately.
